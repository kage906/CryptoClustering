# Introduction:

Hello, and welcome to my Github repository for my CryptoClustering project. In this project, I explore how to cluster cryptocurrencies based on market data using K-Means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). This project was completed as part of my portfolio for data science and machine learning, and it was an excellent opportunity to hone my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

# What is the project about:

The goal of this project was to cluster cryptocurrencies based on market data and compare the clustering results using K-Means clustering with and without principal component analysis (PCA). Specifically, I wanted to answer the question of whether PCA would improve the clustering results by reducing the dimensionality of the data. To do this, I used Python and a variety of data science and machine learning tools.

# What I did:

In this project, I began by loading the data into a pandas DataFrame and performed some initial data exploration and visualization. Then, I normalized the data using the StandardScaler module from scikit-learn and created a DataFrame with the scaled data. I used K-Means clustering to cluster the data and plotted the Elbow curve to determine the optimal number of clusters.

I then used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and repeated the clustering using K-Means on the reduced data. Finally, I visualized the clustering results using scatter plots and compared the results of clustering with and without PCA.

# What tools were used:

To complete this project, I used several tools, including Python, pandas, scikit-learn, hvPlot, and Jupyter Notebook. These tools allowed me to load and preprocess the data, perform clustering and principal component analysis, and visualize the results.

# What I learned:

Through this project, I learned the importance of data preprocessing and cleaning, especially when dealing with large datasets. I also gained experience using K-Means clustering and principal component analysis, which are essential techniques in unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, I learned how to visualize clustering results using scatter plots and how to use hvPlot to create interactive visualizations.

# Conclusion:

Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity to develop my skills in data science and machine learning. Through clustering cryptocurrencies based on market data, I gained experience in data preprocessing, clustering techniques, and data visualization. I also learned how to use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve clustering results. I hope that this project serves as a useful example of my skills and abilities as a data scientist and that it demonstrates my passion for exploring data and discovering insights.
